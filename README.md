# Executive Summary

In this lab we will be going over object oriented programming, structured query language, the code of ethics and why copyrights are important. 

# Object Oriented Programming

Create a class (using paper and pencil or using the Microsoft whiteboard app) for the following: a) Phone b) House c) Employee
Identify the features (In the video for the Car class, we identified the properties as Year, Make Model etc)
Identify the actions (In the video a) for the Car class, we identified the methods as Drive, Park, Start etc)
Then upload a screenshot of your diagram to github for each of the above classes.
# Data, Information and Knowledge

## Relational Data

What is the difference between data, information and knowledge?
Data is raw bits of information without context, where information connects data with context, and knowledge is used to make decisions and spark innovation. 

If you were creating a database for a small company and two tables you identify are customers and orders explain the following: (be sure to use the example in the chapter as a guide - customers and orders would be like clubs and events) a) What would be the primary key in the customers and orders table?
A primary key for customers could be their last name followed a number in order that the customers signed up. The order number could be their primary key of their last name and number followed by a hyphen with another number linked to their order for example "Keck1-40392"

b) How would the customers and orders table be related?
Customers would place their order through their account, this would save what they have boughten and what they like, then the order number would be tied to the specific product they purchased. 
c) What would be the foreign key in the orders table?
A foreign key of the orders table would be the history of what the customer has ordered. This links what the customer likes and already has to reccommend them new things.

d) The orders table would likely have a date field. Explain why it is important to properly define the data type of a field.
It is important to properly define the datd type of the field so it is easy to find this data, and confusion when calling this data.
## Big Data

Briefly describe the four "Vs" of big data
The four "Vs" big data are Volume, Variety, Velocity, and Veracity, Volume is the scale of data, Variety is the different forms of data, Velocity is the analysis of streaming data, and Veracity is the uncertainty of data. 
What types of technology have driven the increased need for big data?
Online ordering is an example of a technology that has made the need for big data, amazon has millions of orders that have to deliver to their customers
# Structured Query Language (SQL)

Explain RDBMS and how it relates to SQL and the purpose of SQL
RDBMS also known as Relational Database Management System is the basis of SQL.  
Pick two related tables from the diagram provided in the "module - SQL" and explain the relationship between them a) which is the primary key? b) which is the foreign key?
Two related tables from the diagram that I picked were, orders and customers. In this case the customers would be the primary key and the orders would be the foreign key. The reason behind this is because the person does not change while the things they ordered do.
Products and Suppliers
Using W3Schools, try out a a) select statement a) where clause and upload screenshots of the results.
Explain how SQL injections are a security threat and what can be done to reduce the issue.
SQL injections are a security threat because they can allow someone to access all of your data. To my understanding this is based off of 1=1 always being true. SQL uses parameters to not allow this. Parameters try to block these attacks by checking to make sure that it is right for the column being accessed. 
# Ethical and Legal Implications of Information Systems

## Code of Ethics

Explain the purpose of a "code of ethics" and why the ACM created a code for the computing discipline.
The purpose of the "code of ethics" is that it outlines a set of behaviors for a group. ACM created a code for computing disipline to keep people using information technology for the right reasons. 
Explain the difference between a code of ethics and AUP (acceptable use policies.)
The difference betweeen a code of ethics and acceptable use policies are that code of ethics are guidelines without many consequences while AUP is that they are also guidelines but these can come with concequences such as getting kicked off of a businesses wifi. 
Pick a site of your choice and read the AUP. Select a policy of interest and report your findings (include a link to the site in your report.)
The site I picked was Twitch.TV (because I stream on this platform). Their AUP has a lot to do with virtual money called "bits". Bits clearly stated to not be used a gambling, the purchase of tobacco, and alchol. 
## Intellectual Property

From the chapter follow the link to the WIPO. What is the purpose and importance of the WIPO?
The WIPO purpose is to help support inovation online. This is important because it allows doctors inside of our bodies through x-rays, creating smart phones, and help create content online while avoiding copyright issues. 
Using links in the chapter explain how a copyright is obtained and the benefit of registering for a copyright with the US Copyright Office. Explain why it might be important to copyright the svg image you created.
Copyrights can be obtained by an application online. This is important so other people cannot take your ideas or creations online. Using a copyright for an SVG image I created would be a good idea to ensure not everyone can use it unless I am being compensated for it. 
If the svg image you created became an item that identifies a source of goods or services, explain the role of a trademark in defining the intellectual property.
The role of a trademark on an SVG image that I created allows for this image to be reconginized to a brand. This allows unity for when people see my image they know what it is tied to.
## Information Collection

Explain how COPPA, FERPA and HIPPA restrict the collection of information on the Internet.
HIPPA does not allow one's medical documentation by just anyone. If there is a breach in this, HIPPA then has a law ensuring that the one's information that has been leaked, has to be notified. 
# Conclusion

Include what you have learnt from this lab
I learned the importance of copyrights, why we should use copyrights, and the corelation between different fields through SQL
